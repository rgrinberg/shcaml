 * Fittings represent processes, internal or external, that produce,
 * consume, or transform data.  This module provides basic
 * constructors to make fittings out of both external UNIX commands
 * and internal {!Shtream} functions, and fitting combinators
 * that combine fittings in a variety of ways.
 *
 * This module includes both functions specialized to shtreams of
 * {!Line.t} and a functor for creating a structure specialized for
 * sthreams of other types.
