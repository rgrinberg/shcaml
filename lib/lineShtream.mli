(** Shtreams of {!Line.t}s.
 * This module is the result of applying {!AnyShtream.Make} to the
 * module {!LineElem}.
 * Thus, shtreams handled by this module are compatible with the shtreams
 * of {!Shtream}, {!StringShtream}, and modules created by
 * {!AnyShtream.Make}, but this module provides additional functions
 * for reading and writing ['a Line.t Shtream.t]s.
 *
 * This module specializes shtream-creating functions to store source
 * information in the resulting lines.
